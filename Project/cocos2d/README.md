cocos2d-x
=========

We've removed the cocos2d-x sources from this folder. The reason is that they would add more than 300MB to the size of this repository.

This tutorial code was built with [cocos2d-x 3.9](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/filedown/cocos2d-x-3.9.zip). It should also run with the newest release of cocos2d-x &mdash; you can get it from the [download page](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download).

To run this project simply copy the contents of the downloaded zip file into this folder. The structure of the project folder should like this:

* Classes
     * ...
* cocos2d
  * AUTHORS
  * build
     * ...
  * CHANGELOG
  * cmake
     * ...
  * cocos
     * ...
  * ...
